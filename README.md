# WebSocket Chatroom Project

This project is focused on creating a scalable chatroom system using modern C++ features and web technologies. The core architecture will include a **TCP WebSocket server**, **HTTPS handshake** for user authentication, and a custom logging system utilizing advanced C++20 metaprogramming techniques.

## Project Overview

The project is in its **early stages**, with initial steps already implemented. The goal is to create a real-time chat application that supports multiple users. A central server will handle WebSocket connections, providing an interactive chat experience for users.

## Key Features  

### 1. TCP Server  
- Acts as the central hub for incoming traffic, allowing clients to choose their desired service.  
- Supported services:  
  - **Broadcast Messaging**: Send messages to all connected clients.  
  - **Private Chat**: Chat one-on-one with a specific user.  
  - **Group Chat**: Create and manage private group chats with selected friends.  

### 2. Microservice for User Authentication  
- A separate microservice handles user authentication and login.  
- Uses **HTTPS protocol** to ensure secure communication.  
- Stores user data (e.g., email and password) securely in an **SQL database**, enabling users to log in with their credentials for future sessions.  

### 3. Client-Side Registration  
- Users must register and create an account on the server before accessing chat services.  
- Registration includes providing a valid email and password for authentication.
- Chosing a desired service
- Start to chat

### 4. Branch-Based Development  
- The project follows a branch-based versioning approach on GitHub.  
- Each branch represents a different implementation or feature set.  
- Explore different branches to experiment with various stages of development and added functionalities.

## Current Status  

The project is in its early stages of development, and not all functionalities have been fully implemented. Work is ongoing to enhance both the client-side and server-side features.

## Project Structure

### `main.cpp`

The `main.cpp` file contains the core logic for setting up the **TCP WebSocket server**:

- **TCP WebSocket Initialization**: The code establishes a WebSocket server on port 3000, allowing users to connect and send/receive messages in real-time.
- **Chatroom Functionality**: The basic structure for a chatroom, including support for multiple users, is in the initial stages of implementation.

### Header Files

The header files contain essential classes and utilities for the project:

1. **`Buffer_Sanitizer`**: A utility class designed to extract and sanitize input, ensuring that only readable characters are passed to the console.
2. **`LOGGER`**: A custom logging class implemented using C++20 metaprogramming techniques:
   - **Variadic Templates**: Used to handle an arbitrary number of log arguments.
   - **`constexpr`**: Allows certain log operations to be evaluated at compile-time, improving efficiency.
   - **SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)**: Template specialization and SFINAE techniques are used to automatically detect and format different data types, ensuring that only printable types are logged.

## Current Progress

- **Initial Setup**: The basic framework for the WebSocket server and chatroom functionality is established.
- **TCP WebSocket Server**: The WebSocket server is functional and listening on port 3000.
- **Logging System**: The custom `LOGGER` class has been designed and partially implemented with C++20 features.

## Future Plans

- **Server Relay Architecture**: The next step will involve implementing a relay server to handle communication between clients and the central server.
- **User Authentication**: Implementing HTTPS for the handshake process to authenticate users before establishing the WebSocket connection.
- **Extended Chatroom Features**: Adding more features to the chatroom such as user authentication, private messages, and message history.

## Technologies Used

- **C++20**: Advanced C++ features such as metaprogramming, variadic templates, and `constexpr` are used to create a flexible logging system and other utilities.
- **WebSockets**: Real-time communication protocol for handling chat messages between the server and clients.
- **HTTPS**: Used for securing the WebSocket handshake and authenticating users.
- **Bash Scripting**: For configuring and running the server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
2. Run the server setup script (listener-port3000.sh) to start listening on port 3000:
   ./www/listener-port3000.sh
3. Compile and run the C++ code:
   g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp -o chatroom
./chatroom
